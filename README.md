# Data-science-Mini-Project
Sales Data Analysis and Prediction
Project Overview
This project is a data science mini-project that analyzes a sales dataset to uncover insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. The analysis is performed in a Google Colab notebook using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The project includes data cleaning, visualization of sales trends, and a linear regression model to predict sales.
Dataset
The dataset (train.csv) contains sales records with the following key columns:

Row ID: Unique identifier for each record
Order ID: Unique order identifier
Order Date: Date of the order
Ship Date: Date of shipment
Ship Mode: Shipping method
Customer ID/Name: Customer details
Segment: Customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
Country/City/State/Postal Code/Region: Geographical details
Product ID/Category/Sub-Category/Product Name: Product details
Sales: Sales amount

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in sales data.
Visualize relationships between variables such as category, region, and sales.
Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict sales based on selected features.

Tools and Libraries

Python: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning (linear regression, model evaluation)
Google Colab: Environment for running the notebook

How to Run

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


Open in Google Colab:
Upload the DSc_MiniProject.ipynb notebook to Google Colab.
Ensure the train.csv dataset is uploaded to your Colab environment or accessible via a mounted Google Drive.


Install Dependencies:
The notebook includes imports for all required libraries, which are pre-installed in Google Colab. If running locally, install dependencies using:pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn




Run the Notebook:
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform data loading, EDA, visualization, and modeling.



Key Steps in the Notebook

Data Loading: Load the train.csv dataset using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Inspect the dataset structure and summary statistics.
Identify missing values and handle them if necessary.
Analyze sales trends by category, region, and other features.


Data Visualization:
Create plots (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) to visualize sales distributions and correlations.


Predictive Modeling:
Prepare features for modeling (e.g., encoding categorical variables).
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model to predict sales.
Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.


Results Interpretation:
Summarize findings from EDA and model performance.
Highlight key insights about sales drivers.



Results

EDA Insights: Identified top-selling categories, regional sales variations, and customer segment preferences.
Visualizations: Generated plots to showcase sales trends and correlations.
Model Performance: The linear regression model provides a baseline for sales prediction, with MSE and RÂ² scores indicating model fit.

Future Improvements

Incorporate additional features (e.g., time-based features from order dates).
Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Enhance visualizations with interactive plots using Plotly.
Address any data quality issues (e.g., outliers, missing values) for improved model accuracy.
